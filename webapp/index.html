                    <p>Mentor Ventures Inc. (operating mobile application called Dusk) is a Delaware corporation that: (i) creates, produces and distributes entertainment Content (as defined below); (ii) offers users the opportunity to participate in community media applications by submitting (e.g., "uploading") User Materials (as defined below) to the Dusk mobile application(App)/or websites so that such User Materials can be distributed to the general public via the Dusk mobile App Sites and the Dusk App Services (as defined below); and (iii) offers users the ability to order, participate in, and download digital copies of still images (as defined below) via the Dusk App.

                        These Terms of Service (this "Agreement") set forth certain terms and conditions of the legal contract between you and Dusk (Mentor Ventures Inc) with respect to your use of Dusk App, whether you are an unregistered visitor ("Visitor"), a free account holder ("Registered Member"), or a paying subscriber ("Paid Subscriber"). By using any Dusk App products or services, you agree to be also bound by the Dusk App Privacy Policy (click here). In addition, if you make any purchases on Dusk App, you agree to be also bound by the Dusk App Terms of Sale (click here).</p>

                    <h2>1. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS:</h2>
                    <p>As used herein, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth as follows:

                        "Content" means and includes, without limitation, photos, images, artwork, graphics, videos, audios, animations, text, editorials, comments, writings, personal information, music, liner notes, lyrics, and other elements and materials, in any media or format now known or hereinafter devised, whether physical, electronic, digital, analog or otherwise.

                        "Collaborative Content" means any customized Content that results from Users incorporating User Materials into Dusk App Content (as defined below) as the functionality of Dusk App Services may allow and enable from time to time. An example of Collaborative Content would be a video or image resulting from you inserting your own photo or video into a image template.

                        "Dusk Content" means any and all Content (excluding User Materials) made available on Dusk App, including Content owned or controlled by Dusk and/or its corporate affiliates, as well as Content licensed or otherwise provided to Dusk App by Licensors/Suppliers (as defined below).

                        "Dusk Services" means any and all services, tools, Software (as defined in Section 23), applications, and functionalities as may be provided on Dusk App from time to time.

                        "Licensors/Suppliers" means any and all third parties that make available to Dusk App (pursuant to a license or otherwise) their proprietary Content, products or services for use, deployment, display, performance, and/or distribution via the Dusk App. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Licensors/Suppliers" includes third parties that place, display, or distribute their advertising, promotional, or sponsorship Content on the Dusk App.

                        "Trademarks" means any and all marks, brands, logos, designs, character names, location names, slogans, catch words and phrases, business names, trade names, trade dress, packaging designs, label designs, webpage layouts, look and feel, and other indicia of source, origin or identification, owned or controlled by Dusk, its corporate affiliates, and/or Licensors/Suppliers. Any and all Trademarks owned or controlled by Dusk and/or its corporate affiliates, including, without limitation, the Dusk App name and logos and characters, and the layout and design of the Dusk App, are referred to hereinafter as "Dusk App Trademarks"; and any and all Trademarks owned or controlled by Licensors/Suppliers, including, without limitation, those listed in the legal notices referenced in Section 2 below, are referred to hereinafter as "Licensors/Suppliers Trademarks."

                        "User Materials" means Content which users upload, submit, record, stream, distribute, or otherwise make available via the Dusk App and/or through Dusk App Services, but excluding any and all Dusk App Content.</p>

                    <h2>2. TERM/FEES:</h2>
                    <p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for as long as you use any of the Dusk App Services, whether as a Visitor, Registered Member, or Paid Subscriber ("Term"). You may terminate your free account or subscription at any time, for any reason by following the instructions available by joining our Slack community to talk directly with our support team. Dusk App may terminate your free account or subscription at any time, for any reason, effective immediately upon sending notice to you at the email address you provided during the account set-up process, or such other email address as you may subsequently provide to Dusk App. If Dusk App terminates your free account or subscription in the Service due to a breach of this Agreement, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of subscription fees (if any). Even after the free account and/or subscription is terminated, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, provided, however, that the User Materials submitted by you may no longer be accessible on Dusk App once your account has been cancelled.

                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that once your User Materials are integrated into a Dusk App (e.g., photos, audio files, or videos integrated within an animation, promotion, video, or any Dusk App production, regardless of media format), all of the licenses for such materials, as granted in Sections 8 and 9 of this Agreement, shall extend in perpetuity, meaning that Dusk App will have the perpetual right throughout the world to exploit such Dusk App production embodying your User Materials in any and all media now known or hereafter devised.

                        By using Dusk App Services and/or by becoming a Paid Subscriber, you acknowledge that Dusk App (Mentor Ventures Inc) reserves the right to charge a payment for Dusk App Services and the right to terminate your account or subscription should you breach this Agreement or fail to pay for the Service, as required by this Agreement.
